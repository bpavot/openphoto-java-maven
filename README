#### OpenPhoto, a photo service for the masses

### How to use the library

To use the library you need to first include openphoto.jar in your project, then instantiate an instance of the class OpenPhotoClient and start making calls.
    
    OpenPhotoClient client = new OpenPhotoClient(host, consumerKey, token, tokenSecret);
 
 	// it will get a list of objects 
    List list = client.rawGet("/photos/list.json");
    // it will post
    client.rawPost("/photo/62/update.json", array('tags' => 'tag1,tag2'));
  

----------------------------------------
### JUnit Test

You can test the client with JUnit.
First, set the details on TestEnvironment.java

     consumerSecret=your_consumer_secret
     token=your_access_token
     tokenSecret=your_access_token_secret
